# The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need

This will contain my notes and exercises for the
[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) course:
["The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)
by [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen).

## Introduction

As the course overview says:

> "[...] a super fun, beginner-friendly data structures and algorithms course.
> Is it really the last algorithms course you'll need? If you want to pass tough
> interview questions, then yes! You'll learn big o time complexity, fundamental
> data structures like arrays, lists, trees, graphs, and maps, and searching and
> sorting algorithms."
